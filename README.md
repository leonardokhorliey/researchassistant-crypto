Presentations and proposed solutions to problem cases in application for a Research Assistant role.

This repository contains my Submissions for the Role of a Research Assistant in Cryptocurrency. 
It includes 5 files which are solutions to five problem statements. The problem statement, grouped into 3 classes, included a Finance aspect, a Computer science aspect and a mathematics aspect, with the last containing only one problem statement unlike the other two which contain 2 each.

The problems in the Financial aspect included preparing an argument for why the bitcoin stock to flow model is a bad one, which I did some research to come up with the write-up as can be seen in the respository, and the second being to compute the call price for a particular stock based on the Black-Scholes model.
The Black-Scholes model is simply a statistical equation used to predict the eventual call price of a particular stock using the main stock price and exercise price and discounting back to the initial start date via an exponential computation.

The Computer science aspect included a write-up on why the recursion method is not advisable in computing a Fibonacci number, and the second was to create a project which was to take in a proth number and test if it was prime.
For the latter, I used the Java programming which I am comfortable with. A proth number is simply a number that isn't composite and follows a particular Proth theorem. The algorithm method used here is called the Las Vegas algorithm, which always gives a true answer, via an indefinite number of iterations.

The Mathematical aspect included just a problem to determine the minimum value of a particular function. This was simply computed using the differential calculus. The first differential was computed first and used to determine the values of the independent variable at the turning points, by making the first differential equal to zero.
A search method was then used to determine which of these optimum values gives the smaller value of the function and this gave the minimum value of the function.

Attached also is a copy of my CV to serve as a biodata for reference purposes. All necessary information about me can be found in it.
